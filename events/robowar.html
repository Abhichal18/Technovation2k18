      <br>
     Every match will consist of 3 rounds of 3 min each with a time gap in between. <br>
 A robot is declared victorious if its opponent is immobilized. <br>
 A robot will be declared immobile if it cannot display linear motion of at least two inches in a
time period of 30 seconds. <br>
 In case both the robots remain mobile after the end of the round then the winner will be
decided subjectively. <br>
 A robot that is unsafe, as deemed by the judges, will be disqualified immediately and the
opponent robot will be declared as the winner. <br>
 If a robot is thrown out of the arena then the robot still inside the arena will automatically be
awarded 5 points immediately, and the round will continue after bringing both the robots in
their respective corners. <br>
 Robots cannot win by merely lifting their opponents. Organizers will allow lifting for a maximum
of 20 seconds for each lift and then the attacker robot will be instructed to release the
opponent. If, after being instructed to do so, the attacker is unable to release, their robot will be
penalized.The final decision remains in the hands of the Judges.
        <br>
        If two or more robots become entangled due to any reason and becomes trapped within
another robot, then the competitors should make the timekeeper aware and the fight should be
stopped and the robots should be separated by the safest means. <br> <br>
# Points will be given on the basis control, and strategy.of aggression, damage. <br>
 Aggression – Aggression is judged by the frequency, severity, boldness, and effectiveness of
attacks deliberately initiated by the robot against its opponent. If a robot appears to have
accidentally attacked an opponent, that act will not be considered Aggression. <br>
 Control – Control means a robot is able to attack an opponent at its weakest point, use its
weapons in the most effective way, and minimize the damage caused by the opponent or its
weapons. <br>
 Damage – Through deliberate action, a robot either directly or indirectly reduces the
functionality, effectiveness or defensibility of an opponent. Damage is not considered relevant
if a robot inadvertently harms itself. Also, if a pressure vessel or a rapidly spinning device on a
robot fragments, any damage to the opponent will not be considered 'deliberate'. <br>
 Strategy – The robot exhibits a combat plan that exploits the robot's strengths against the
weaknesses of its opponent. The strategy is also defined as a robot exhibiting a deliberate
defense plan that guards its weaknesses against the strengths of the opponent

</div>
  <div class="tab-pane" id="rule" role="tabpanel">
      
        <br> Each team can have a maximum of 5 participants. <br>
 A team may consist of students from different colleges. <br>
 Certificates of Excellence will be awarded to the top two teams. <br>
 Any team if asked will have to change its wireless module frequency/coded channel, so as to
avoid clashes with the opposite team. <br>
 If there is any kind of ambiguity in the selection of the weapon systems, please clarify the same
with the event organizers to avoid further confusion. <br>
 If the organizers doubt the safety of viewers due to a particular bot, then that team might be
denied participation. <br>
 The bot is not allowed to leave anything behind during the run. It should not leave any mark on
the arena <br>
      
       The time measured by the organizers will be final and will be used for scoring the teams. Time
measured by the contestant by any means will not be considered for scoring. <br>
 In case of any disputes/discrepancies, the organizers’ decision will be final and binding. The
organizers reserve the right to any of the above rules as they deem fit. Changes in rules, if any
will be highlighted on the website and notified to the teams. <br> <br>
NOTE:- All the combat robots should be operated only after meeting the necessary security clearance. It
is advised that the participants operate the bot at their own risk and shall be responsible for any
mishaps caused due to their negligence. TECHNOVATION, I.E.R.T. ALLAHABAD shall enforce strict
security measures during the event. Any security glitches found in the bot by the judges shall be
disqualified immediately.

</div>
  <div class="tab-pane" id="botspecification" role="tabpanel">
        <br>
       The bot should fit in a box of inner dimensions 50cm x 45cm x 45 cm (l x b x h) at any given
point during the match. (Controllers are not included). <br>
 The motors used in the robot wheels should be given a nominal 5A, 15V supply(Maximum). <br>
 For wireless bots: The bot should not exceed 15 kgs of weight including the weight of pneumatic
source/tank (Controllers are not included). <br>
 For wired bots: The maximum onboard weight limit is 15 kgs, and there is no off-board weight
limit. <br>
 All pneumatic/hydraulic source, tanks should be on the bot itself. <br>
 The power supply for the robots is allowed to given directly from the source. 230 V direct AC
supply will be provided. <br>
 Again, remember that the weight of adapters and the remote controller will not be included in
these constraints.

</div>
  <div class="tab-pane" id="botcontrol" role="tabpanel">
      
        <br>For Wireless Robots: <br>
 Ensure that the wireless system transmission takes place through the arena boundaries. <br>
       The robot wireless systems must have a way to change frequencies or coded channels to
prevent radio conflicts (i.e. if you are using 4 frequencies you need to have at least 2 more
alternate frequencies readily available). <br>
 Toy radio systems are allowed at this event. <br>
 Tethered control is not allowed. <br>
 If you are using a home built control system, you must first clear it with the Event Managers. <br>
 Pairing must be done before the bot is entered into the arena <br> <br>
For Wired Robots: <br>
 In any case, if the bot gets damaged during the fight, the authorities will not be responsible and
the ongoing match will not stop. <br>
 Please carry at least 6m long wire for your convenience. <br>
 Only battery and controllers are allowed outside the arena. Anything else than these shall lead
to disqualification.
      </div>
    <div class="tab-pane" id="eands" role="tabpanel">
          <br>
         Any kind of inflammable liquid. <br>
 Flame-based weapons. <br>
 Any kind of explosive or intentionally ignited solid or potentially ignitable solid. <br>
 High power magnets or electromagnets. <br>
 Radio jamming, tazers, tesla coils, or any other high-voltage device. <br>
 Tethered or untethered projectiles. <br>
 Weapons or defences that stop combat completely of both (or more) robots. This includes nets,
tapes, strings. <br>
 Liquid projectiles.
